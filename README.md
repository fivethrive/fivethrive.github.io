# Humble Pied

### What’s this all about?
Inspiring makers sharing one piece of advice, all over video chat.

Humble Pied originally started as a friend-sourced presentation for a student design conference, with peers offering their words of wisdom within the creative industry. This project was made to house all of the great bits of advice, and to start great conversation along the way.
