# Humble Pied
==========

One inspiring creative sharing one piece of advice, all over video chat.

Humble Pied originally started as a friend-sourced presentation for an AIGA student conference, with peers offering their words of wisdom within the creative industry. This project was made to house all of the great bits of advice, and to stimulate dialogues along the way.
