<p>Finally the hassle of setting up KISSmetrics on Shopify is history! We built an app that gets a Shopify store completely integrated with KISSmetrics by simply adding the API key provided in your KISSMetrics account settings!</p>

<h3 id="save-time-and-money">Save time and money</h3>
<p>What typically costs somewhere between $400 and $700 dollars to have a developer manually integrate can now be done in less than a minute! It also uninstalls cleanly without any extra work! This gives you more time to learn the KISSmetrics product and really evaluate the free trial.</p>

<h3 id="complete-worry-free-integration">Complete worry-free integration</h3>
<p>KISSmetrics offers documentation with <a href="http://support.kissmetrics.com/best-practices/ecommerce-essentials.html">best practices</a> for their ecommerce clients and this app takes care of everything on the list. The guess work around making sure the data is being sent to KISSmetrics correctly is removed because all of the heavy lifting is already done and validated.</p>

<p>This app even includes data from cancelled or refunded orders and allows a Shopify merchant to track customer behavior from initial visit to checkout to return visit and items returned!</p>
