Liz comes to us with experience as a designer, editor, information architectâ€”and of course, an educator. She's worked with the likes of AIGA, Barnes & Noble, Happy Cog and Razorfish, and now is the chairperson of the MFA in Interaction Design program at The School of Visual Arts in New York. In a world of to-do lists and getting-things-done, Liz helps us to realize the wonders and opportunities of not having a set plan.
