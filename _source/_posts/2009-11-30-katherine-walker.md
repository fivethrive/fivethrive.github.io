Katherine Walker is a designer and illustrator originally from Tennessee, now residing in the Windy City. She's one of the designers at the always-awesome Grillo Group in Chicago. She's got a serious knack for type, and possibly a grudge with Captain Crunch. Katherine was also one of the seven designers who competed nationally in the 2009 AIGA National Design Conference's graphic design reality show: Command X.
