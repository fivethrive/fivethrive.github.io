Jim Coudal is the founder of Chicago's very own creative company, Coudal Partners. Jim and his crew transitioned from being a traditional design office to a company that pursues passion projects they truly give a damn about. Some of their experiments include Field Notes memo books, The Deck ad network and even the Adobe-sponsored Layer Tennis matches on Fridays. If you don't see Coudal Partners editing new content for their site, it's probably because Jim is off speaking at another major design conference.
