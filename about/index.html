  <h2>How the project all began</h2>
  <p>Humble Pied originally started as a presentation for an AIGA student conference in 2009. I asked peers to offer their words of wisdom within the creative industry. This project was made to house all of the great bits of advice, and to stimulate dialogues along the way.</p>

  <h2>Technically speaking</h2>
  <p>All chat sessions were held with iChat or Skype video and recorded with ScreenFlow. Each interview was cleaned up and edited with Adobe After Effects, Photoshop and Soundbooth. The site is powered by WordPress and developed in Coda. The videos are hosted on Vimeo Plus. The typefaces are FF Tisa and FF Dagny. This was also additionally fueled by iced mochas, love and really awesome friends.</p>
