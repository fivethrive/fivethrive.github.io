  <h2>How this project all began</h2>
  <p>Humble Pied originally started as a presentation for an AIGA student conference in 2009. I asked peers to offer their words of wisdom within the creative industry. This project was made to house all of the great bits of advice, and to stimulate dialogues along the way.</p>

  <h2>Technically speaking…</h2>
  <p>Humble Pied was an exploration with the technologies that existed in 2009—along with my greener skill set at the time. The website design was loosely sketched in Photoshop, where I was able to quickly move into HTML and CSS. The first publishing system was WordPress. Endless Google searches lead me to cobble together my own platform to release new videos every few weeks. My coding tool at the time was Coda.</p>
  <p>Today, Humble Pied is a lean and mean static site generated by Jekyll, Sass, and CoffeeScript by means of SublimeText 2.</p>
  <p>There wasn’t any “video interview” software at the time, so I pieced together the videos the best way I knew how: video recording my entire computer screen during an iChat or Skype video call. From there, every interview was cropped and edited in Adobe After Effects. I made my way through Adobe Soundbooth just enough to edit audio.</p>
  <p>All videos are hosted on Vimeo Plus. I really admire Vimeo’s commitment to artists and original, crafted content.</p>
  <p>The typefaces are FF Tisa and FF Dagny, both of which are served through Typekit.</p>
