  <h2>How this project all began</h2>
  <p>Humble Pied started as a presentation for a student design conference in 2009. I wanted to pass on the advice given to me early on in my career to the students, so I asked peers and former bosses to offer their words of wisdom within the creative industry. This project was made to house all of the great bits of advice, and to start great conversation along the way.</p>

  <h2>Technically speaking</h2>
  <p>Humble Pied was an exploration with the technologies that existed in 2009. The website design was loosely sketched in Photoshop, where it quickly moved into HTML and CSS. The original publishing setup was WordPress. Endless Google searches helped me hack together my own system to release new videos every few weeks. My coding tool at the time was Coda.</p>
  <p>There wasn’t any “video interview” software at the time, so I pieced together the videos the best way I knew how: capturing my entire computer screen during an iChat or Skype video call. From there, every interview was edited in Adobe After Effects and audio was edited with Adobe Soundbooth.</p>
  <p>All videos are hosted on Vimeo Plus. I really admire Vimeo’s commitment to artists and original, crafted content.</p>
  <p>Today, Humble Pied is a lean and mean static site generated by Jekyll, Sass, and CoffeeScript hand-typed in SublimeText 2.</p>
  <p>The typefaces are FF Tisa and FF Dagny, served through Typekit.</p>
