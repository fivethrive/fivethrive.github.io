Two wicked dudes make up 36 Point, Nate Voss and Donovan Beery. Donovan runs his own studio in Omaha, Eleven19, while Nate is a designer + illustrator + all around great guy. Together, they also run a design podcast on 36 Point called The Reflex Blue Show, where they discuss today's creative industry topics. Most recently, they were both on stage at this year's 20/20 at the AIGA Make/Think conference curated by Debbie Millman.
