### Why we build integrations for Shopify

For a merchant selling online, [Shopify][shopify] is our favorite platform by far. In fact, we love it so much we've built a number of integration applications to help merchants increase their conversion rate. You may have noticed from our home page that we have primarily integrated with analytics platforms. "Why," you might ask, "can't those integrations be done without your apps?"

Well, sure. If you're a highly technical person. We tell people who have development teams that they do not need to use our integrations all the time. The thing is, we didn't make the integrations to help those people who can and want to manually integrate with theses services. We built them for the merchant who wants to focus on honing their store's usability, the layout, the marketing copy. We built them so you, the merchant, can focus on your product.

If you're passionate about your product, you probably don't want to spend time messing around with theme files, javascript tags and validating that your integration data is being tracked properly. That's where we come in. We've integrated with the services we have found to provide some of the most useful information in helping improve conversion rates.

### KISSmetrics

Customer analytics provide the metrics needed to understand who your customers are and how they interact with your business. KISSmetrics is customer analytics at its finest and getting it set up on your [Shopify][shopify] store has never been more complete and simple with our integration app. Plus, when you're done, it removes cleanly from your shop upon uninstallation!

### CrazyEgg

Heatmaps give clear and compelling information about how your user interacts with your storefront. CrazyEgg and KISSmetrics were both founded by Neil Patel so it made sense to provide integrations for both. [Get CrazyEgg tracking your customers!][crazyegg]

### Navilytics

Not just another heatmap tool, we are really impressed by this one! Full discloser: we are affiliates of [Navilytics](https://www.navilytics.com/?r=1476) but because we believe in them so much we are willing to put our name behind a recommendation. They offer a free tier so you can try them out today at no cost! We give you 14 days to try our integration for free too so what are you waiting for, [watch recordings of your customers interacting with your shop today][navilytics]!

I'm sure there will be more as we continue to work with shops all over the world looking for easier integration with other services. Feel free to contact us if you would like us to integrate a service for you too!
