### Façadify reaches the end of its life

Facadify started out as a joint venture to make it super simple to integrate Google Content Experiments on a [Shopify][shopify] storefront. This, like many adventures, went very well in the beginning. It helped many people but not nearly as many as we'd hoped. Then, other projects came along, took priority and eventually Façadify fell into disrepair. Unfortunately, Façadify never did quite fully meet the needs of the customers and therefore, we decided to decommission the integration and amicably part ways on the venture.

If there is enough interest, perhaps someday we will take the lessons we learned with Façadify and build out something to meet the need of A/B testing a [Shopify][shopify] store.
