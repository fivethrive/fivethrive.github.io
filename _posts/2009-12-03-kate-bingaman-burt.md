Kate is often found illustrating fancy things based on personal consumerism. The likes of IDEO, New York Times, HOW and Print Magazine love her, and we do, too! She's always inspiring students as well, being a professor at PSU and most recently speaking at the student symposium of the AIGA Make/Think National Conference.
